#Contributing!

### Greetings and Salutations, Humans and Robots of the Internet!

So... You want to know how to contribute...

Start by forking the project! There are Ideas, Bug Fixes, and All sorts of things in the "issues tab." Go there for some fun! Lots of Ideas and Code are passed around.

After you are satisified, you can then submit a pull request. There may be some discussion before your code is accepted.

Documentation is VERY VERY WELCOME!!! Any part that may need documentation is listed in "issues". If you find an area need Documentation, then feel free to write some!
